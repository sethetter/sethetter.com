# ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Seth

I'm a software engineer working in tech since 2012.

During that time I've honed my understanding of what it takes to build good software, at both the technical and organizational levels.

You can also find me at [seth.computer](https://seth.computer) where I [write things](https://seth.computer/notes) and [share links](https://seth.computer/links).
